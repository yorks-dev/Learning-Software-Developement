Lets learn recursion through 3 great questions.

* QUESTION 4.4.1: Write a recursive function that given an input n 
* sums all non negetive integers upto n.

> n = 5
> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 (ANS)

*/

WHO DO YOU SOLVE IT ?
---------------------
Solving it by solving a simpler version of the problem.
Look for repetative tasks in the problem, its where recursion can be applied.

STEP 1 :
-------
Whats the somples possible inpput for the question ?

STEP 2 :
PLay around with examples.

STEP 3 :
Relate hard cases to simpler cases

STEP 4 :
Write code by combining recursive pattern with the base case.
